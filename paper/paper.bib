	abstract = {Dispersed across the Internet is an abundance of disparate, disconnected training information, making it hard for researchers to find training opportunities that are relevant to them. To address this issue, we have developed a new platform—TeSS—which aggregates geographically distributed information and presents it in a central, feature-rich portal. Data are gathered automatically from content providers via bespoke scripts. These resources are cross-linked with related data and tools registries, and made available via a search interface, a data API and through widgets.https://tess.elixir-europe.org.},

	abstract = {In this white paper, we describe the founding of a new ELIXIR Community - the Systems Biology Community - and its proposed future contributions to both ELIXIR and the broader community of systems biologists in Europe and worldwide. The Community believes that the infrastructure aspects of systems biology - databases, (modelling) tools and standards development, as well as training and access to cloud infrastructure - are not only appropriate components of the ELIXIR infrastructure, but will prove key components of ELIXIR’s future support of advanced biological applications and personalised medicine. By way of a series of meetings, the Community identified seven key areas for its future activities, reflecting both future needs and previous and current activities within ELIXIR Platforms and Communities. These are: overcoming barriers to the wider uptake of systems biology; linking new and existing data to systems biology models; interoperability of systems biology resources; further development and embedding of systems medicine; provisioning of modelling as a service; building and coordinating capacity building and training resources; and supporting industrial embedding of systems biology. A set of objectives for the Community has been identified under four main headline areas: Standardisation and Interoperability, Technology, Capacity Building and Training, and Industrial Embedding. These are grouped into short-term (3-year), mid-term (6-year) and long-term (10-year) objectives.},
